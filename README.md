# Budget-tracker
In this branch, I have a uploaded an initial version of the Budget Tracker website whicjh consists of mainly two pages:
a. Login Page
  -> The file login.html corresponds to login page where we may enter the website using the username: admin and password: abc.
b. Tracker Page
  -> The file Tracker.html corresponds to the main page where monitoring and tracking of the Budget is performed.
  -> As of now, we can enter the total income recieved, the category of the expense and the amount of expense incured and it will be displayed graphically.

Other files: 
  -> budget.jpg - picture uploaded in login page
  -> calculate.js - this is the main logic of the budget tracking system. Here, the expenses incured are subtracted from the total income and the total savings and expenditure can be displayed at the end of every month. (this function is currently not working)
